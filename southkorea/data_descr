2. The Structure of our Dataset
What color means is that they have similar properties.
If a line is connected between columns, it means that the values of the columns are partially shared.
The dotted lines mean weak relevance.db
3. The Detailed Description of each Data Table
# This Python 3 environment comes with many helpful analytics libraries installed
# It is defined by the kaggle/python docker image: https://github.com/kaggle/docker-python
# For example, here's several helpful packages to load in 

import numpy as np # linear algebra
import pandas as pd # data processing, CSV file I/O (e.g. pd.read_csv)

# Input data files are available in the "../input/" directory.
# For example, running this (by clicking run or pressing Shift+Enter) will list all files under the input directory

import os
for dirname, _, filenames in os.walk('/kaggle/input'):
    for filename in filenames:
        print(os.path.join(dirname, filename))

# Any results you write to the current directory are saved as output.

Before the Start..
We make a structured dataset based on the report materials of KCDC and local governments.
In Korea, we use the terms named '-do', '-si', '-gun' and '-gu',
The meaning of them are explained below.
Levels of administrative divisions in South Korea
Upper Level (Provincial-level divisions)
Special City: Seoul
Metropolitan City: Busan / Daegu / Daejeon / Gwangju / Incheon / Ulsan
Province(-do): Gyeonggi-do / Gangwon-do / Chungcheongbuk-do / Chungcheongnam-do / Jeollabuk-do / Jeollanam-do / Gyeongsangbuk-do / Gyeongsangnam-do
Lower Level (Municipal-level divisions)
City(-si) List of cities in South Korea
Country(-gun) List of counties of South Korea
District(-gu) List of districts in South Korea

1) Case
Data of COVID-19 infection cases in South Korea
case_id: the ID of the infection case
case_id(7) = region_code(5) + case_number(2)
You can check the region_code in 'Region.csv'
province: Special City / Metropolitan City / Province(-do)
city: City(-si) / Country (-gun) / District (-gu)
The value 'from other city' means that where the group infection started is other city.
group: TRUE: group infection / FALSE: not group
If the value is 'TRUE' in this column, the value of 'infection_cases' means the name of group.
The values named 'contact with patient', 'overseas inflow' and 'etc' are not group infection.
infection_case: the infection case (the name of group or other cases)
The value 'overseas inflow' means that the infection is from other country.
Tha value 'etc' includes individual cases, cases where relevance classification is ongoing after investigation, and cases under investigation.
confirmed: the accumulated number of the confirmed
latitude: the latitude of the group (WGS84)
longitude: the longitude of the group (WGS84)
